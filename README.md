## Info
These are a bunch of little modules i've been working on for Deathrun Neue. This requires the base gamemode to work and will house little additions or modifications you can turn on and off as you see fit.

I've decided to make it a standalone thing because i saw that things were starting to get a little messy if i were to continue modifying the base gamemode

Keep in mind that this is these are the works of a amature and also a side project, if you decide to use this code I will be very grateful, but don't expect a load of support from me

More info will be added when I decide how i'm gonna do things
